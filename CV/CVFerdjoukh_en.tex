% {\bf Keywords:} Model Driven Engineering, Test Model generation, Testing of Model Transformations. 

% \medskip

% My research takes place in the context of Model Driven Engineering. During my phd. (2013-2016), I worked in the \grimm{} project. The main objective was the automated generation of models for testing. We used constraint programming to improve performance. The issue of meaningfulness for models was tackled using probabilities and empirical study. During this work, I developed two tools: \grimm{} and \comodi.

% \medskip

% My current work is related to testing and verifying model transformations. I focus on exploiting the output of a verification tool to automatically generate precise and meaningful tests.
